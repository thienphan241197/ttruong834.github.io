Hi there. I'm Thi Truong - a researcher, engineer, and generally hobbyist maker and enjoyer of stuff. 
I was born and raised in Vietnam and currently, Iâ€™m over at Georgia Tech diving into the world of Computer Science. This site documents much of my thoughts and what I have done in my life in terms of career and creative pursuits.

If you are curious, I am more specifically interested in:
- AI/machine learning (increasingly, the deep kind)
- robotics (particularly, intelligent robotics that can interact with humans)
- fish (to the point I learn scuba diving just to see more of them)
- books (science, history, some pre-modernist)
- programming (especially embedded programming)
- snowboarding (aiming to carve out more time on the slopes)
